# TEXTaiLES: Digital Tools for Cultural Heritage Textiles

Welcome to the official GitHub organization page for **TEXTaiLES** (TEXTile digitizAtIon tools and mEthodS for cultural heritage), it is a project funded by the European Commission under Grant Agreement n.101158328 and by the Swiss Confederation.

## The Project

In this digital age, cultural institutions are confronted with unprecedented challenges regarding sharing and digitising Cultural Heritage (CH) content, as well as collaborating and connecting with one another. To address these issues, the creation of the [European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage](https://www.echoes-eccch.eu/) (ECCCH) offers a significant chance to encourage CH institutions into widely using collaboration platforms and tools. As a part of the ECCCH, TEXTaiLES employs key emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D digitization, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud/Edge Computing, Robotics, Digital Twins (DTs) to develop a **standardized, cutting-edge technological and methodological ecosystem** for the entire textile digitization lifecycle.

## 🛠️ Core Technologies & Innovation

TEXTaiLES is a highly interdisciplinary project, fusing **computer science, AI, robotics, sensor technologies, and cultural heritage (archeology, conservation)**.

| Technology Area | Core Innovation/Components |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Acquisition** | **Robotic Platforms (UAV/UGV):** Custom, safe-by-design, and cost-effective vehicles equipped with multi-sensor arrays (RGB, multispectral, terahertz, lidar) for autonomous and contact-free scanning. **Dynamic Path Planning** adapts the robot movement in real-time to ensure consistent and targeted data collection. |
| **Data Processing & Analysis** | **AI-Empowered Tools:** Algorithms for **surface morphology and microstructure analysis**, **degradation detection/localization**, and **automatic restoration** of damaged parts. **Textile Dynamics and Motion Modeling** simulates how fabrics behave under stretching, shear, bending, torsion, or compression. |
| **Digital Toolkit** | **4D Collaborative Environment:** A web-based 3D viewing, editing, and annotation platform supported by **Digital Twin (DT)** models. The DT tracks alterations over time (4D) and links with real-time sensor data (IoT) for continuous monitoring and predictive preservation. |
